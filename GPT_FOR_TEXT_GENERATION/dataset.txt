 Lagos State Government Public Service Rules Foreword 
FOREWORD 
It seems trite to contend that there is nothing that fairly mirrors the image, 
perception and indeed the effectiveness of any Government like the image, perception 
and effectiveness of its Public Service. I have heard people refer to the word 
"bureaucracy" as if it was itself a bad thing. Checking up on the meaning of the word 
confirms what I already knew. It refers to a body of rules, procedures and processes by 
which things are done. 
In my opinion this is a good thing. A large workforce like the Lagos State Public 
Service, inclusive of its Local Government employees, numerous Parastatals and 
Commissions comprising over one hundred thousand people, employed to relate with 
members of the public, provide services and solve problems, require Rules of 
Engagement. Without clear processes, rules and procedures, their conduct within and 
with members of the public would be simply chaotic. The "bureaucracy", the rules, 
processes and procedures for the conduct of Public Service are contained in the "Public  
Service Rules" and this is a good thing. 
What needs to be borne in mind is that society is evolving daily, people are 
changing, their needs are changing, technology is also having a huge impact in how 
things are being done. It is when the rules do not catch up with these changes that 
difficulties may arise and  “bureaucracy” may become counter-productive. 
Since the return of democratic governance in 1999, a lot of reforms have taken 
place in Lagos State, making the Lagos State Public Service the pack leader in 
developmental initiatives. Unfortunately, the existing Civil Service Rules was last 
reviewed in 19 82. Between then and now, reforms in Pension Administration, 
application of technology, adoption of Oracle software and business processes, unique 
Identity Numbers for Public Officers, extension of Maternity Leave for female officers  
from 3 months to 6 mo nths with full pay, and the introduction of Paternity Leave for 
male officers have taken place. Service Charters and Mission Statements have now 
become part of the operational ethos of Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the 
Lagos State Government. 
 I have had cause to utilize Executive Orders or cause the issuance of Circulars 
to bring these developments in conformity with the existing Rules. In the 
circumstances, the necessity to revise the existing Rules becomes compelling. The new 
Public Service Rul es  is the outcome of the initiative to bring our bureaucracy in 
conformity with changing local and global trends.  
The change of nomenclature from "Civil Service Rules”  to “Public” Service 
Rules is an attempt to make the rules applicable to Parastatals,  Commissions  and other 
 Lagos State Government Public Service Rules 
(ii) 
Agencies of Government that have hitherto not been considered part of the main Civil 
Service; because Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government are 
interconnected  and   inter-dependent,  it  is  important          
(i) 
 Lagos State Government Public Service Rules Foreword 
that  they all operate by a uniform set of processes and procedures in Human Resource 
Management. 
The road to these new Rules is somewhat long. It started with the tenure of 
Yakub Abiodun Balogun as Head of Service, continued during the tenures of Adesegun 
Ogunlewe and Josephine Oluseyi Williams as Heads of Service and we reach a glorious 
completion during the tenure of  Folashade  Jaji as Head of Service. I am grateful to all 
of them, the Office of Establishments and Training (the custodian), their staff, members 
of various Committees who contributed selflessly to the evolution of these new Rules 
and t he State Executive Council members who debated and passed the motion for 
adoption and implementation. 
I can only now commend the new Rules to the entire Public Servants  in the 
hope that they will improve the service delivery capacity of the Lagos State Pu blic 
Service.

Preamble 
PREAMBLE 
This document is the product of intensive review of the rules and  regulations 
guiding career management in the State Public Service. Without any iota of doubt, 
several reform programmes have been undertaken in the Lagos State Public Service 
since the adve nt of civilian rule in May 1999 and it is only logical that they be 
adequately accommodated in the new Public Service Rules. 
2. Lagos State Public Servants are therefore enjoined to fully acquaint themselves 
with these Rules, which should be applied alongside corresponding Executive Orders, 
Instruments, Gazettes, Circulars and Notices as we are duty bound to operate in 
accordance with all Laws and Procedures guiding Public Service Management, Public 
 Lagos State Government Public Service Rules 
(iii) 
Finance Management as well as Policies and Strategies in the State to ensure due 
diligence through transparency, accountability and probity in the conduct of 
Government business. 
3. Accordingly, our attention is being drawn to the following guidelines, which 
should be taken into account while going through these Rules: 
(i) Method of Numbering 
Each Rule has been accorded a six -digit number. The first two indicate the 
Chapter; the next two, the Section; and the last two, the Rule Number. (e.g. 
130201 is the First Rule in the second Section of the thirteenth Chapter or Rule 
One, Section Two of Chapter Thirteen.) 
(ii) Arrangement of Chapters, Sections and Rules 
There are eighteen Chapters arranged as listed in the Table of Contents 
(iii) Amendments 
Amendments to these Rules shall be effected through Circulars, which will be 
issued from time to time. 
(iv) Review of the Public Service Rules 
This treatise shall be reviewed periodically to update the provisions of the Rules. 
4. This Public Service Rules should be widely circulated and made available to all 
categories of Public Servants in Lagos State as they are require to familiarize 
themselves with its contents.

Such an extension may result in the incremental penalty referred to in Rule  
050206 if the Commission or the relevant body so decides. 
 
020302:  Within his probationary period, an officer is required to pass the 
prescribed examination appropriate to his appointment:

020304:  The probationary period shall last a maximum of 2 years. 
Extension to the two -year probation period may be granted only where

confirmed in his appointment after passing the prescribed examination 
during the

probationary period on the second anniversary of his  appointment and his 
maturity date for advancement/promotion would thus be calculated from

probationary period, he would be confirmed in his appointment on the date 
he passes the exams and not on the second anniversary of his appointment.

he passed the exams to observe his maturity date for advancement/ 
promotion. This condition would also apply to an officer whose 
probationary period is extended, on the recommendation of the appropriate 
authority, due to unsatisfactory performance. He would be confirmed in 
his appointment on the end date of the extended probationary period.

absent for a short period (e.g. on casual leave or on  sick leave) does not in 
itself justify an acting appointment; there may, however, be circumstances

whether an acting appointment is necessary or desirable in any particular 
case shall rest with the State Civil Service Commission.

in the gazette notice reverting the officer's appointment.  Normally, the 
gazetted date of cessation shall be that on which the acting officer 
relinquishes the duties and responsibilities of  the post, except that if he 
hands over to the substantive holder, the gazetted date of cessation will not 
normally be later than the date on which the latter, before taking over: (a) 
arrives in the station, 
(b) ceases to hold substantively, or to act in, another post in the same 
station, 
(c) ceases vacation leave in the same station, whichever is 
applicable according to  circumstances.

must be fixed at the time the increment is deferred and must not be less 
than three months nor more than six months; if less than six months in the 
first instance, it may, if necessary , be increased to six months by an 
additional specific deferment. If a deferred increment is eventually granted, 
it does not become effective until the day following the expiration of the 
specific period of deferment, but the recipient retains his original  
incremental date for subsequent increments.  If a deferred increment is not 
granted at or before the expiration of six months from the date it was 
originally due, it must be withheld.  
050206:  An officer's increment is withheld when it is decided not to grant 
it and  he  shall cease to be eligible until his next incremental date.  The 
withholding of an increment thus results in the salary of the officer in 
question remaining for the rest of his incremental service one increment 
behind what it would have been had the increment not been withheld. 
050207:  An increment deferred or withheld cannot be restored with a 
retrospective effect in consequence of improved service during a later 
increment-earning period.
